            <h2>What is Ovarian Cancer?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>When cancer starts in the ovaries it is called ovarian cancer; women have 2 ovaries located in the pelvis. Ovaries make female hormones and produce eggs. Ovarian cancer can arise from different cell types within the ovary. The surface of the
            ovary, also known as the epithelium, gives rise to the majority ovarian cancers (about 90-95%). These are known as epithelial ovarian cancers. Other less common types may occur but are not what we will discuss today. Recently, we have learned
            that what we used to think of as “ovarian” cancer can actually arise in the fallopian tubes; this is called fallopian tube cancer. Fallopian tubes are paired structures that arise from the uterus and have finger-like projections that sweep
            over the ovaries to capture eggs produced from the ovaries. It is typically in the fallopian tube that an egg meets a sperm in the process known as fertilization. Those finger-like projections are typically where we see fallopian tube cancer
            start. For simplicity, today, I will usually say “ovarian cancer” referring to the combination of epithelial ovarian cancer and fallopian tube cancer. I also want to point out that the ovaries and fallopian tubes are in the same large cavity
            or space with the stomach, intestines, liver, abdominal/pelvic organs and are bathed by the same lubricating fluid that circulates in the abdominal-pelvic cavity. This idea will be important to understand some of the symptoms of ovarian cancer
            and how ovarian cancer spreads. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer in the United States and is the country’s fifth most common cause of cancer mortality in women. In 2016, it was estimated that
            there were more than 22,000 new diagnoses and more than 14,000 deaths from this neoplasm occurred in the United States. Sadly; less than 40% of women with ovarian cancer are cured. The risk of being diagnosed with ovarian cancer increases
            with age and is most common in women who are in their 60s and 70s. About 90% of women who get ovarian cancer will be older than 40 years. The typical age at the time of diagnosis is 63 years, and more than 70% of patients present with advanced
            cancer that has already spread to the upper abdomen. At this point, it is much less likely to achieve a lasting cure.

            <h2>Why is screening for ovarian cancer so difficult?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>The goal of screening is to identify ovarian cancer at a more localized and potentially curable stage, leading to fewer women dying from ovarian cancer. But we need to consider the potential risks associated with screening for ovarian cancer.
            A positive screening result suggestive of ovarian cancer most often is followed by surgery (either laparoscopy or laparotomy, an open abdominal incision). These very invasive procedures are associated with physical and psychological morbidity,
            a small, but very real, risk for serious complications, and substantial financial costs. Although ovarian cancer is an important cause of cancer death, the number of women newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the general population is relatively
            low. The problem of an incorrectly-positive screening test becomes critically important in diseases like ovarian cancer that are uncommon. Unless the test or sequence of tests is extremely accurate, a large number of healthy women would be
            at risk for unnecessary surgery. That is not to say that screening strategies have not been investigated here in the US and abroad. However, these large studies have not resulted in significant improvement in lives saved. We do not recommend
            routine ovarian cancer screening for the general population.

            <h2>How is Ovarian Cancer Diagnosed?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Unfortunately, most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed in an advanced stage, when disease has spread to the upper abdomen. This is because the location of the ovaries in the shared abdominal/pelvic cavity and the biology of most epithelial
            cancers. Ovarian cancer cells can spread in many different ways. The first is through direct extension, like moss on a tree. The second is tissue invasion, like the roots of that tree growing into the ground. Another way is like a dandelion
            fluff blown in the breeze. Through this exfoliation process, ovarian cancer cells can float in the lubricating fluid of the abdomen/pelvis and seed any surface in the abdominal/pelvic cavity, even as far away as our diaphragms. The last pattern
            of spread is through small vessels in the lymphatic and vascular channels throughout our body. The usual presenting symptoms of ovarian cancer are a result of the mass effect of a large ovarian tumor, inflammation caused by cancer and the
            growth of cancer metastases that have landed throughout the abdomen/pelvis via exfoliation. The problem is that these symptoms are common and more often than not the diagnosis is not ovarian cancer.

              <h3>Symptoms suggestive of ovarian cancer include:</h3>
            </header>

            <div style="width:400px;float:left;">
              <ul>
                <li>An increase in abdominal size or bloating</li>
                <li>Pelvic or abdominal pain</li>
                <li>Difficulty eating or feeling full quickly</li>
                <li>Urinary symptoms (urgency or frequency)</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <aside style="width:400px; height: 97px; float:right; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:25px; background-color: #52C3D0; ">
                <p style="font-style: italic; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px;">Pay special attention if these symptoms are new and frequent (>12 d/mo)</p>

            </aside>
            <p> Women and health care providers that care for women should be aware that these vague symptoms are common in women with ovarian cancer, but the vast majority of women with these symptoms will not have ovarian cancer because these symptoms can
              be caused by other more common conditions. If we are not thinking of ovarian cancer as a possibility, we simply will not be able to diagnose it. A patient’s evaluation for these symptoms should include a comprehensive physical exam, some
              sort of imaging study-most often, a pelvic ultrasound, possibly a CT scan and often blood tests. I had mentioned earlier, when we were discussing screening, that if a patient has a positive screening result, the next diagnostic step is surgery.
              That seems like a big leap, right? Why not biopsy something, if we are concerned it could be cancer? Well, we worry that if there is a mass in the ovaries (but no evidence of metastatic disease) putting a needle into it could rupture it
              spreading cancer cells throughout the abdomen and pelvis, “upstaging” the patient and making cure less likely. Ultimately, most patients undergo surgery to remove an ovarian mass and with the help of a trained pathologist we obtain a diagnosis.

              <h2>What are Risk Factors for the Development of Ovarian Cancer?</h2>
            </header>
            <p>First, I would like to review factors that can decrease the risk for ovarian cancer. These include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prior pregnancy</li>
              <li>Use of oral birth control pills for more than 5 years</li>
              <li>Having their tubes tied</li>
              <li>Removal of both ovaries</li>
              <li>Hysterectomy</li>
              <li>Breast feeding for more than 12 months</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Conversely factors that put women at increased risk for ovarian cancer include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Never having had a pregnancy</li>
              <li>Older age at pregnancy</li>
              <li>Endometriosis</li>
              <li>Family history of ovarian, breast, colon, uterine cancer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While most women who get ovarian cancer, do not have a family history of ovarian cancer, there are two genetic/hereditary cancer syndromes that are important to mention:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (this one is pretty self-explanatory) include those patients with mutations in the BRCA1 (RR 35-46%) and BRCA2 (RR 13-23%) genes.</li>
              <li>Lynch Syndrome. In this syndrome, some of the more common cancers include colorectal, uterine and ovarian cancer (3-14%)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Both of these genetic predisposition syndromes are associated with early onset ovarian cancer in women. In women at high risk for ovarian cancer, prophylactic removal of tubes and ovaries significantly reduces the risk of developing these
              cancers. Unfortunately, in a small number of these patients, we find cancer at the time of the risk-reducing surgery. </p>

            </header>
            <ol>
              <li>Ovarian cancer while uncommon presents most often in your 60s and 70s.</li>
              <li>Most women diagnosed with ovarian cancer have no family history of ovarian cancer</li>
              <li>We do not have screening tests sensitive enough to screen the general population for ovarian cancer</li>
              <li>Pay attention to your body. If you have new/frequent/persistent/worsening bloating, difficulty eating or feeling full fast, and/or changes in bowel or bladder function see your health care provider. Be persistent until symptoms resolve or
                you have a diagnosis that explains how you are feeling.</li>
              <li>Treatment should involve a medical team experienced with treatment of patients with ovarian cancer. This should include a gynecologic oncologist, if possible. </li>
              <li>In women at high risk for ovarian cancer, prophylactic removal of tubes and ovaries significantly reduces the risk of developing these cancers.</li>
